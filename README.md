# Crop Weed identify and servo control

This project is a Capstone Project in Electronic Engineering at Suranaree University of Technology. This part of the project involves finding the center point of vegetation and sending the values to control a servo through Pyserial. The Jetson Xavier will be used to run the model.

## Installation and Usage Instructions

You should install the modules listed in the requirements.txt file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**The model invocation and training will follow YOLOv5 version 7.0.**

## It is recommended to connect the circuit to an Arduino UNO R3 as shown in the image below.
